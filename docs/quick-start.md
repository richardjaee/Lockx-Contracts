# Quick start

Follow these steps to connect your wallet and create your first Lockbox.

1. **Connect your wallet** — click *Connect wallet* in the top bar and choose MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, or Brave Wallet. Accept any popup.
2. **Authenticate session** — sign a short EIP-712 message to open a 3-hour session (no gas fee).
3. **Select assets** — in *Portfolio* choose *Create Lockbox* (or *Create new Lockbox* within an existing one) then pick up to 3 tokens / NFTs to bag.
4. **Choose key-management & pay fee**
   * Self-custody keys — **$4.99** platform fee, you manage the secondary key & 2FA yourself.
   * Lockx key-fraction — **$9.99** platform fee, our encrypted fraction combines with your signature for withdrawals (HSM-backed, FIPS-3).
5. **Mint your Lockbox** — derive the secondary key, then mint the soul-bound Lockbox NFT to your wallet. Deposit or withdraw anytime with no extra fees.
