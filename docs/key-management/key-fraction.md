# Key fraction technology

**Key fraction technology (KFT)** splits a private key into two random halves so the full secret never sits in one place.

| Symbol | Held by | Storage |
|--------|---------|---------|
| 𝑘ᴾ (platform fraction) | Lockx backend | Encrypted Google-KMS HSM |
| 𝑘ᵁ (user fraction) | Your wallet | Transient EIP-191 signature |
| 𝐾 = 𝑘ᴾ ⊕ 𝑘ᵁ | Derived on demand | RAM for milliseconds |

A thief must compromise **both** your wallet *and* the HSM within the 60-second signing window—a tall order.

## Signature flow

```
User wallet   Sign 𝑘ᵁ ─────┐   (never leaves device)
                               ▼
Lockx backend   decrypt 𝑘ᴾ      ⊕   →  derive 𝐾   →  sign EIP-712  →  erase 𝐾
```

The resulting signature is handed to the withdrawal transaction where `ecrecover` validates it.

---

## Security wins

* No single point of failure: leak either half → still safe.
* Rotatable: you can rotate 𝑘ᴾ or 𝑘ᵁ independently if a device is lost.
* Hardware-anchored: 𝑘ᴾ lives in an HSM with audit logs.
* Cheap: avoids on-chain multisig gas cost.

## Choosing a tier

| Tier | Key location | Requires hardware? | Fee |
|------|--------------|--------------------|-----|
| Self-custody | Full key in your wallet | Recommended (Ledger/Trezor) | $0 |
| Key-fraction (KFT) | Split halves | Wallet + 2FA | $9.99/mo |

Switch anytime by withdrawing and redepositing with the desired tier.


Lockx offers an optional **key-fraction** tier for users that prefer extra security without losing self-custody.  Instead of storing a full private key anywhere, the key is deterministically re-derived on-demand from *two* independent pieces – one held by you, the other held (encrypted) by Lockx.

## Zero-trust architecture

!!! tip "No single point of compromise"
    Neither Lockx nor the user ever holds the entire key at rest.  A thief would need to breach *both* sides **and** pass 2-factor authentication within the short signature window.

---

## How it works

1. **User authentication** – the dApp asks you to sign a fresh session message containing a random **client fraction**.
2. **Server fraction** – Lockx stores an encrypted random fraction in Google Cloud KMS backed by FIPS-3 HSMs.
3. **Ephemeral key derivation** – when you initiate an operation (withdrawal, key rotation, etc.) the two fractions are hashed together to create a one-time ECDSA key pair.
4. **Expiring signature** – the derived private key signs a typed EIP-712 message that includes `deadline`, nonce and operation fields.  The signature is valid for minutes, not days.
5. **Immediate cleanup** – the private key is wiped from memory.  To sign again the fractions must be recombined, so there is no lingering secret.

---

## Security benefits

* No full private key ever exists on disk.  A database leak reveals nothing useful.
* Derivation requires both your wallet **and** server-side KMS (protected by 2FA).
* Each signature is time-boxed → replay window is tiny.
* Fractions can be rotated independently, giving you proactive defence if a device is lost.

## Key export & recovery

!!! warning "Proof of ownership required"
    The encrypted **platform fraction** (𝑘ᴾ) is handed to you during setup.  Keep it safe—Lockx cannot recover it for you.

To export or recover the full private key you must present **all three** factors:

1. A fresh wallet signature proving you still control 𝑘ᵁ.
2. The encrypted 𝑘ᴾ blob you downloaded at setup.
3. A valid 6-digit TOTP code (if 2FA is enabled).

Once verified, the backend derives 𝐾 in volatile memory, delivers it to you over an end-to-end encrypted channel, **then wipes it immediately**.  The key must be re-derived for any future export.

!!! tip "Advanced-tier HSM protection"
    Subscribers on the **Advanced** plan have their server fraction protected by a FIPS-3 Hardware Security Module.  Extraction attempts are logged and rate-limited at the hardware level.

## Comparison of tiers

| Tier | Who holds key? | Platform fee | Ideal for |
|------|----------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Self-custody** | User stores full private key (e.g. hardware wallet) | $4.99 | Power users comfortable managing backups |
| **Key-fraction** | Split: user wallet + encrypted KMS fraction | $9.99 | Users wanting extra assurance & 2FA without hardware wallet |


Split an ownership key into shares stored on separate devices. Any 2-of-3 can sign a withdrawal, lowering the chance that one lost phone bricks your funds.
