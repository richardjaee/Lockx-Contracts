# Wallet attack protection

Lockx isolates vault withdrawals behind a **second signing key** (KFT or self-custody) that lives outside your hot wallet.  Below is a threat-model walkthrough comparing a traditional wallet to a Lockbox-protected vault.

| Scenario | Without Lockx | With Lockx |
|----------|--------------|------------|
| Private-key leak | Attacker drains ETH, ERC-20 & NFTs with one tx | Needs **two** signatures: wallet + Lockx key.  NFT itself is soul-bound, cannot `transferFrom`. |
| Seed-phrase leak | Wallet can be restored on attacker‚Äôs device | Seed phrase reveals _no_ Lockx key fraction; vault still safe. |
| Blind-sign attack | Malicious dApp hides calldata, gets unlimited approval | Lockbox only accepts typed EIP-712 payloads; amounts & recipients visible. |
| Malware/RAT | Trojan scrapes extension storage for keys | Lockx key is never stored on disk; derived on-demand & wiped. |
| Airdrop drainer | Airdropped token hooks `transfer` to re-enter | Only owner can deposit; inbound tokens inside Lockbox can‚Äôt execute code. |

## Deep-dive: attack scenarios

??? danger "Wallet private-key compromise"
    Attacker drains entire wallet once the key is leaked.

    !!! info "Lockx defence"
        ‚Ä¢ Soul-bound NFT cannot be transferred.  
        ‚Ä¢ Withdrawal requires EIP-712 signature from the **Lockx key**.  
        ‚Ä¢ Attacker would need to hack both wallet **and** KMS-backed key fraction within the 5-minute deadline.









??? danger "Signature phishing"
    Malicious site asks you to sign ambiguous hex.

    !!! info "Lockx defence"
        ‚Ä¢ Contract only accepts **typed** `Withdraw*` structs with chainId, nonce, and amount.  
        ‚Ä¢ Wallet UI shows these fields in plain English, so phishing blobs are obvious.






??? danger "Blind signature / permit drainers"
    ERC-20 `permit` blobs can mask unlimited approvals.

    !!! info "Lockx defence"
        Lockbox assets ignore `permit`; only explicit withdrawals signed by **both** keys are accepted.



??? danger "Malware & RATs"
    Trojan scrapes extension storage for keys.

    !!! info "Lockx defence"
        ‚Ä¢ Lockx key never lives on disk ‚Äì derived on-demand & wiped.  
        ‚Ä¢ ùëò·¥æ fraction sealed in HSM; ùëò·µÅ requires fresh wallet sig + TOTP.






??? danger "Seed-phrase compromise"
    Restoring the wallet elsewhere recreates private keys.

    !!! info "Lockx defence"
        Seed phrase reveals no Lockx key fraction ‚Äì vault remains safe; simply rotate user fraction and recover funds.

??? danger "Wallet drainers & scam sites"
    Malicious sites connect wallets then auto-drain via approvals or transfers.

    !!! info "Lockx defence"
        ‚Ä¢ Lockboxes are soul-bound; cannot be transferred.  
        ‚Ä¢ Every withdrawal requires a second EIP-712 signature from the Lockx key.  
        ‚Ä¢ Contract exposes no generic `approve` path; assets stay isolated.

??? danger "Malicious airdrops"
    Attackers airdrop tokens with hidden hooks that drain wallets on interaction.

    !!! info "Lockx defence"
        ‚Ä¢ Lockboxes accept deposits only from the token owner.  
        ‚Ä¢ No automatic token acceptance; malicious tokens stay outside the vault.

??? danger "Proprietary wallet infrastructure risks"
    Closed custodial flows can lock users out and introduce vendor risk.

    !!! info "Lockx defence"
        ‚Ä¢ Works with any ERC-721 compatible wallet.  
        ‚Ä¢ Dual-key model uses open standards; smart contract is immutable & public.

??? danger "Seed-phrase compromise"
    Restoring the wallet elsewhere recreates private keys.

    !!! info "Lockx defence"
        Seed phrase reveals no Lockx key fraction ‚Äì vault remains safe; simply rotate user fraction and recover funds.

Lockx therefore turns a single-point-of-failure wallet into a **two-factor, typed-data-only** withdrawal flow, stopping the most common drain vectors seen in 2024-25.
