# Roadmap

_Planned milestones beyond v1.0.0. Dates are tentative and may shift based on audit results and community feedback._

| Quarter | Feature | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Q3 2025 | **Zero-trust integrations** | zk-proof flow so the protocol never learns what asset or amount was deposited/withdrawn. |
| Q3 2025 | **ERC-1155 batch support** | Single call to deposit/withdraw multiple ids & amounts; invariant tests and gas optimisations. |
| Q4 2025 | **Layer-2 & multi-chain** | Optimism, Base, Arbitrum first; roadmap extends to Solana and Bitcoin via Taproot Assets. |
| Q1 2026 | **Permissionless plugin hooks** | Extensible interface for per-lockbox on-withdraw logic (e.g. auto-staking). |
